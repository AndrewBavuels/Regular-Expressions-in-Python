# Regular Expressions in Python 🐍✍️💻

## 1. Description 👇

This guide provides practical examples focused on using **Regular Expressions (Regex)** in Python.

It covers string manipulation techniques, pattern matching, and advanced regex usage, based on the exercises from the [Regular Expressions in Python course at DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/regular-expressions-in-python).

The project is organized into the following sections:

```sh
.
├── README.md
├── data
│   ├── short_movies.csv
│   ├── short_tweets.csv
│   └── wikipedia.csv
└── notebooks
    ├── Part 1. Strings Operations.ipynb
    └── Part 2. Regular Expressions.ipynb
```

- **data/**: Contains the raw data and the processed data.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for each part of the course, including hands-on examples of string operations and regex applications.

## 2. Technology stack 💻

### Programming language

- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)

### Python Libraries

- [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html): Regular expressions for working with strings.

To use the library in your code, simply import it, **as you will see in the noteboks:**

```bash
import re
